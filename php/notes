notes


3 different items:
- aged brie
- backstage passes
- sulfuras

3 variables: 
- sellin 
- quality
- name

## aged brie
increases quality everyday
quality cannot be greater than 50

## Sulfuras
does not decrease in quality or sell in 

## back stage passes
increases in quality when sellin is greater than 10
inscrease by 2 when sellin is between 6-10
<!-- quality to 0 after concert -->


## normal item
normal items decrease in sellin and quality by 1 each day
quality never drops to 0


## todo's 
- check ticket quality increase between 6-10



Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
~~The Quality of an item is never negative~~
~~"Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets~~
~~The Quality of an item is never more than 50~~
"Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
"Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
    Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
    Quality drops to 0 after the concert
"Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
